    <p>Because official bunting data should be used.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>Upon spotting that the UK government included a 'bunting' field in its' Bank Holiday <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json">data</a>, I felt that it needed to be used for something.</p>
    <pre>{"title":"New Yearâ€™s Day","date":"2012-01-02","notes":"Substitute day","bunting":true}</pre>
    <p>My immediate thought was a robot to automatically deploy bunting on days when it is needed, so I set about building one. This was
        in part an attempt to learn more about the use and control of motors, something I've always wanted to be able to do, and to
        improve my almost non-existent abilities with C++.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately I was having trouble retrieving and decoding the large JSON string on an ESP32 (largely, I suspect, due to my own
        inexperience with such devices) so I put together a small website to pre-process the data and return only the data for today.
        That is what you see here</p>
