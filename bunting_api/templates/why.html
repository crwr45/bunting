    <h2>Because official bunting data should be used.</h2>
    <p/>
    <p>Upon spotting that the UK government included a 'bunting' field in its' Bank Holiday
        <a href="https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json">data</a>, I felt that it needed to
        be used for something.</p>
    <pre>{"title":"New Yearâ€™s Day","date":"2012-01-02","notes":"Substitute day","bunting":true}</pre>
    <p>My immediate thought was a robot to automatically deploy bunting on days when it is
        needed, so I set about building one. This was in part an attempt to learn more
        about the use and control of motors, something I've always wanted an excuse to
        do, and to improve my almost non-existent abilities with C++.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately I was having trouble retrieving and decoding the large JSON string on
        an ESP32 (largely, I suspect, due to my own inexperience with such devices) so I
        put together a small website to pre-process the data and return only the
        <a href="http://api.doineedbunting.today/england-and-wales">data for today</a>.
        That is what you see here</p>
    <p/>
    <h2>The Machine</h2>
    <p>The Bunting Machine itself consists of an ESP32, controlling a standard 12v NEMA17
        stepper motor via a DRV8825 stepper motor controller. A simple leaf switch is used
        to sense when a small knot in the string reaches it. That known position is with
        the bunting all the way wound in, and the number of degrees of rotation needed to
        wind the bunting out is used to deploy it.</p>
    <p>The use of the limit switch allows the machine to reset to a known position each
        time it turns on, even if it was half-deployed when powered off.</p>

    <!-- todo: Better picture. -->
    <p>The bunting is part of a continuous loop running from a wooden dowel, round a pulley,
        and back to the dowel. The string is wound in opposite directions around the dowel
        on either side of the pulley, so turning the dowel simultaneously winds string off
        one side, around the pulley, and back onto the dowel on the other side.</p>
    <p>The other main issue was the fact that winding bunting around a dowel gradually
        increases its effective diameter, meaning one turn winds more of the string on
        than is wound off, causing it to get very tight. This is solved by spring-loading
        the pulley to absorb small changes in the length of the string while maintaining
        sufficient tension.</p>
